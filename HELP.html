<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">Introduction to BVE</span></h1>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">1. What is BVE?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">BVE (Brayden's Virtual Environment) is just like Python's IDLE, except it's not built-in, and you can have predefined libraries and what we like to call "BVE functions", which are just glorified pieces of code. These BVE functions are also predefined. You make them yourself and everytime you open BVE you can access any of your functions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">2. Python function Vs. BVE function</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">A "BVE function" refers to BVE's concept of a function and not necessarily standard Python function concepts. BVE's "function" is supposed to be nested Python functions and classes within an "origin" class. Basically, this "origin" class is where all your BVE function data is contained. For user-experience, please try to keep your origin class name the same as the name of the file containing the BVE function.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">3. Can my BVE function access another BVE function?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">BVE functions can access eachother, allowing for collaboration or additions to BVE functions from people who choose to use BVE. If standard BVE function layout is used, which is described in our "Python function Vs. BVE function" section,&nbsp; BVE functions may be accessed just like they are in the environment, addressing them by the name of their origin class.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">4. What are all these files for?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">Let's break it down nice and simple. BVE.py is the virtual environment, it is BVE, that's all you need to know about it. There's another file, "libraries.txt", this contains all the predefined libraries! Add or remove whatever libraries you want in there, remember to separate them by putting them on their own line. Please don't put anything before or after them on the same line if possible. Last but not least, we have our folder called "functions", this contains a text file with each of our BVE functions inside of it. By now you've probably read all about them. If you need more instruction and guidance on these, there's a function called "exampleFunction.txt" you should check out! It can be found in the "functions" folder.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">5. How do I access BVE functions? How do I use them?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">You can use BVE functions just like they're a python class! That is, if they use the standard formatting for a BVE function. If you can't tell, I'd really like you to use a standardized format. It just makes everything so much easier.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">6. Should I know anything else?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #e0e1dd;">Please, if you use code in any form that isn't yours, even in BVE functions, please check it for malicious content. I am NOT responsible for any damages: physical, digital, or even emotional if you just love this project of mine so much that it causes attachment issues. On a more seroius note again; none of my content is intentionally meant to be used for malicious actions and is, in itself, nonmalicious. If you are of the paranoid type, feel free to read through my code, in fact, I encourage it as I would love to add to this project and improve it. If you have any feedback, feel free to report it to me. You can find me on GitHub as TheTurtleStudio.
