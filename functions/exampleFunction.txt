#PLEASE NOTE: All "functions" will be executed and initialized when the environment is spawned. A "function" refers to BVE's concept of a function and not
#necessarily standard Python function concepts. BVE's "function" concept consists of, when possible or needed, nested Python functions within classes; where
#origin (where nested classes and functions reside) class names correspond exactly to the name of the file in which they are in.

#PLEASE NOTE: BVE functions can contain any Python code you want, they can even access other BVE functions as they are in the same scope.
